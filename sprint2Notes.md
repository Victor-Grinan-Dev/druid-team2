pm create new proj, link if wanted new project with the severa json project, and linkit with the user that have acces to it (maybe, i understand?)

one customer (company) has many users
not all the users from the same customer has acces to all projects.

pm give access to invoices to users about specific project info.

give access to projects-invoices separately to users/customer
mikko: \*one person per project have acces to all the project info. not more complicated.

otto: password reset.

victor: is the pm who decides who see what or another super user?
pm cannot create more pms?

victor: can we write/modify severa data? No.

victor: user active attr?
only the people that, related to the project, also the invoices.

victor: how we know what data is revelant to what user, what user is relevant to our app?
